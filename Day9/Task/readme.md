# HR-management-system

## Task 09

### **Overview**

You will continue building on what you achieved in the last task.

## **Requirements**

### **Set up your Github Repository***

- Today you will continue working on your `HR-management-system` repo.
- Update your **README** file to add your changes for today.
- Checkout a new branch called `constructor` for today's task.
- Open it in VS code.

### **Home page**

1. Replace all of your object literals for the `HR-management-system` with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, it creates a new instance.

2. You will refactor the  render function to be a prototype function to render each employee information in a separate card in the home page as shown below. Note that you will use images for the employees in the assets directory.
